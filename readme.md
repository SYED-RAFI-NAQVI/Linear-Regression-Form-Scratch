# Linear-Regression-from-scratch


# step - 1 :

Collect our data - to collect our data we use famous library NUMPY, so import numpy

collect the data from data.csv which is comma seperated values

the data is about the hours of study of students and the scores they got in exam 

# step - 2 :

Defining the hyperparameters such as learning rate, b , m , number of iterations.

where learning rate is the rate of learning which say to learn from given data with certain rate or speed,

where b is the bias or y-intercept which is the point of intersection at y-axis,

m is the slope of the given line, where slope is the rate of change of line,

m and b is derived from a fromula y = mx + b.

num of iterations is the parameter to indicate how much time to take to train the model

# step - 3 :

finding the mean square error of the line for the given data points by using the formula (y - mx + b) **2 / N ====> averaging the error with the total number
points 

where N is the number of points in the data set 

this step finds the Mean Square Error of the intial line.
